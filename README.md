# Keyin College - Semester 2 JavaScript Concepts Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the **Semester 2 JavaScript Concepts Repository** for students at Keyin College. This repository is designed to help students deepen their understanding of JavaScript through detailed notes, examples, and practice exercises. As a teaching assistant, I have created this resource to supplement classroom learning and provide additional support for mastering key programming concepts.
